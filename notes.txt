I'm going to start with the styling. That way I can begin making improvements as I get used to the code.


-Added JavaDoc style commenting for the class (github says to treat the code like my own so "@author" is Matthew Howard)
----As I will likely edit the methods later, I'll JavaDoc them later
-Added more comments inside methods as it was rather inconsistent
-Fixed inconsistent spacing, indentation and comment style
-This is more personal preference but I added braces on single line 'for' loops to make it more explicit, especially given that single line functions have been written with braces
-During this time I've been adding "to do" notes for myself marking out things I've identified as odd or needing attention later
