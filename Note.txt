Extra Assertions:
I assumed accounts can overdraft unlimited amount (unrealistic but fulfills the current requirement).

Extension:
I have some idea on how to associate each account with a unique account number to
reflect more closely to real world application.
(currently it's just 0, 1, 2,... and only unique for each customer, not globally)
However, since the requirements are already met(in my opinion), I'll ask the bank if 
this extension will be useful to the bank.
