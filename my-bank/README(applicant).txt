All files edited by me (Radomir Stanchev), are in my-bank/src/main/java/com/abc.

I could not manage to get the JUnit tests to compile through the command line, so I have not checked 
if they execute successfuly.
(I have no experience using tools like Maven,Gradle, Ant, etc. , nor do I have them installed on my machine.)

Despite that, I have included some tests in my solution.
However, due to time constraints on my part, the tests are very few in number and are far from extensive.

Lastly, again due to time constraints, I have not completed the last task from the "Additional Features" list.
